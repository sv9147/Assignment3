This is AWE dataset, but with bounding-box annotations for IBB: http://ears.fri.uni-lj.si/datasets.html#awe-full

Class IDs are added within the annotations/recognition.

However, if you would like to start the recognition task from scratch, use the images in the folder data/perfectly_detected_ears.
